One solution is to use viewport units (`vw` or `vh`) instead of percentages when calculating widths or heights. Viewport units are relative to the viewport's dimensions, which can resolve inconsistencies when combining units within `calc()`. Another approach might involve restructuring the layout to avoid complex calculations involving percentages and fixed units. For example, instead of `width: calc(50% - 10px);`, consider using two separate elements with appropriate width and margin.
